# car_rental_project
A mock car rental program. Written in python using VS Code. Not the most sophisticated thing, but it works.
Right now, it can take reservation begining in the same month, i.e. a reservation from January 6 to January 21.
It can also take reservations beginning in one month and ending the next, i.e. January 6 to February 17 or October 4 to November 6.
